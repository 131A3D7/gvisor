gVisor implements a large portion of the Linux surface and while we strive to
make it broadly compatible, there are (and always will be) unimplemented
features and bugs. The only real way to know if it will work is to try. If you
find a container that doesnâ€™t work and there is no known issue, please [file a
bug][bug] indicating the full command you used to run the image.

If you're able to provide the [debug logs](../debugging/), the
problem likely to be fixed much faster.

## What works?

*   elasticsearch
