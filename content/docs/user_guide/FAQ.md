### My container runs fine with `runc` but fails with `runsc`

If you’re having problems running a container with `runsc` it’s most likely due
to a compatibility issue or a missing feature in gVisor. See
[Debugging](../debugging/).

### When I run my container, docker fails with: `flag provided but not defined: -console`

You're using an old version of Docker. See [Docker Quick Start](../docker/).

### I can’t see a file copied with: `docker cp`

For performance reasons, gVisor caches directory contents, and therefore it may
not realize a new file was copied to a given directory. To invalidate the cache
and force a refresh, create a file under the directory in question and list the
contents again.

This bug is tracked in [bug #4](https://github.com/google/gvisor/issues/4).

Note that `kubectl cp` works because it does the copy by exec'ing inside the
sandbox, and thus gVisor cache is aware of the new files and dirs.

There are also different filesystem modes that can be used to avoid this issue.
